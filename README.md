# Frontend Mentor - Manage Landing Page

## Introduction

Hello there! My name is Faisal Yudha Nugraha, and this repository contains my solution for the "Manage Landing Page" coding challenge from Frontend Mentor. I want to give credit to [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com) for his excellent tutorial that guided me through this project. In this project, I've utilized HTML, CSS (including Flexbox), and Tailwind CSS as demonstrated in the tutorial.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The foundation of the structure for the landing page.
- CSS: Used for styling and layout.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that assisted in creating responsive and efficient designs.
- Flexbox: Leveraged for building flexible and responsive layouts.

## Challenge Details

The challenge involved creating a landing page based on the provided design, focusing on the following aspects:

- Replicating the design's layout and visual elements.
- Implementing responsive design to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes.
- Utilizing hover states for interactive elements.
- Creating a horizontal slider for testimonials.
- Validating and displaying error messages for the newsletter sign-up form.

## Project Structure

- `/design`: Contains design assets, including both desktop and mobile versions.
- `/images`: Includes optimized image assets required for the project.
- `style-guide.md`: Provides information about the color palette and fonts used.

## Building and Deploying

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project's root folder in your code editor.
3. Use a live server extension to preview your changes while coding.
4. When satisfied with your solution, you can deploy it using platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.

## Installing Node.js and npm

Before you start working on this project, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installing the Required Package

To build the project and generate the main CSS file, you need to have `tailwindcss` installed as a dev dependency. If you haven't installed it already, you can do so by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```sh
npm install tailwindcss --save-dev


```

After installing, you can use the following npm scripts:

```sh
npm run build: Builds the main CSS file from input.css to css/main.css.
npm run watch: Continuously watches for changes in input.css and compiles to css/main.css.
```

Happy coding! ðŸš€
